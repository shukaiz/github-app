This is a cross-platform mobile app developed in React Native through JavaScript that displays the information of any user to nominate on GitHub. More details description could be found in this [PDF Manual](./testplan.pdf).

### Install
You can download source code from here or GitLab and put into a folder. You should also install relevant environments required for React Native to run. It is recommended that you follow the official instruction published by Facebook on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.

### Run
You should also refer to link above since running instructions for different platform is different. For Mac users wanted to run with Xcode's iOS Simulator you could run react-native run-ios inside the source code folder.
```sh
cd FolderName
react-native run-ios
```
